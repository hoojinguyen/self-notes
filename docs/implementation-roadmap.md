## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
1. **PGlite Performance**: Monitor performance with large datasets, implement optimization if needed
2. **Browser Compatibility**: Test early and often on target browsers
3. **Memory Leaks**: Implement proper cleanup in useEffect hooks
4. **Search Performance**: Use database indexes and result limiting

### Timeline Risks
1. **Scope Creep**: Stick to MVP features, document nice-to-have for later
2. **Technical Complexity**: Break down complex features into smaller tasks
3. **Testing Time**: Allocate sufficient time for testing and bug fixes

### Mitigation Strategies
- Weekly progress reviews and adjustment
- Continuous testing throughout development
- Focus on core features first, polish later
- Maintain feature parity with original Haptic as primary goal
